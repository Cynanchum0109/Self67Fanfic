Before the Reindeer's sluggish brain could react, the Rabbit sat astride his lap. One hand pressed against the Reindeer's chest, restraining any possible resistance, while the other pulled out his usual dagger. His butt pressed tightly against the Reindeer's penis.

"Mr. Heathcliff, are you going to prey on me?" The Reindeer's fighting instincts tensed reflexively, but due to "after all, he's Mr. Heathcliff" and a variety of complex reasons that couldn't be generalized, his clenched fists opened again, leaving him defenseless and vulnerable. "Then the next Hong Lu will take some time cleaning the dormitory. After all, Mr. Heathcliff probably won't help mop the floor—"

The reindeer didn't hear what the rabbit said, only seeing his wide eyes. He squinted at the face that had suddenly approached, only to be met with a sea of ​​burning purple flames. Heathcliff's eyes shone with the heat of his own tears and his pent-up desire. Just like the destructive storm during the mission, Honglu swallowed, anticipating the chilling silence that would follow—

"I said, what the hell are you talking about?" A slap, not too light, landed on his cheek, forcibly dragging Hong Lu's dazed thoughts back. The Rabbit's sharp blade skills completely cut open his combat suit from neck to crotch, and with a few more slashes, his pants were torn to shreds.

"Now it's fair. Why should all my clothes be off while you only rip your pants? What do you take me for? A sex toy?"

Ah, he wasn't going to be eaten. The reindeer's heart relaxed with a mixture of relief and disappointment at surviving a close call. The dagger clattered to the ground, and the rabbit angrily bit the reindeer's collarbone, then his chest. Just enough force to grind teeth, but still leaving gradually imprinted red-purple bite marks on the Reindeer's pale skin. Tastes so good... The Rabbit's tongue licked over his own teeth, revealing a ferocious smile. He knelt back a few steps to the Reindeer's crotch, cupped his not-yet fully erect penis with both hands,rubbing it and down as if maintaining a gun barrel.

"Hiss... I'm so- so sorry." Hong Lu's voice came from above the Rabbit who was burying his head in effort, carrying a tone of exhaustion and the weak breathiness after major emotional fluctuations. There was so much he needed to apologize for—for the rape, for the misunderstanding, and for not being able to immediately get an erection to satisfy the excited Rabbit. Heathcliff found it irritating, lowering his head to lick the tip of the penis held in his hands, his tongue circling the head.

Hong Lu's thighs tensed slightly. Heathcliff was clearly pleased by the slight twitch of the muscle, so he left a tooth mark where the tendon was suitable for cutting, then turned back, frowning as he dealt with the half-erect penis.

He couldn't handle this. Heathcliff thought triumphantly, but the salty taste of fluid on his tongue fueled a growing fire in his belly. "Mr. Heathcliff, I think we can—" Hong Lu's voice came at an inopportune moment, his heart leaping at the haphazard, light licks. The Rabbit's patience had long been exhausted. He was never the type to enjoy serving others, so he also gave that cock a slap. The Reindeer's unfinished words were interrupted by a muffled groan, but his penis did indeed stand fully erect exactly as the Rabbit had hoped.

Yes, this is it. A more intense purple flame ignited in Heathcliff's eyes.  The Rabbit roughly stretched himself with two fingers. The previously shot semen mixed with the Rabbit's aroused fluid slid down through his fingers.He practically sprang up on his knees, kneeling between Honglu's legs, guiding his hard penis towards the wet opening—

"Unn—" Both of them let out pained groans simultaneously. Heathcliff showed no mercy to Honglu, nor to himself, sitting down as deep as he could. Hong Lu felt as if his penis was about to break. Heathcliff was in even worse shape, clutching his belly, unsure of what was pressing against him, a bulge forming on his abdominal muscles beneath his hand. Unfortunately, with his head lowered, his expression couldn't be seen—

But he was really, really lewd— Hong Lu waited for the tightening pain at his cock to pass, then immediately lifted his hips. His chest received another slap from the moody Rabbit. "I didn't tell you to move!" Before Heathcliff could even fix the expression that had just shattered, he bared his teeth and scolded the disobedient Reindeer. "Aren't you... umhhh, having a headache? Then rest, okay?" The painful but sweet pleasure gradually overflowed from somewhere in his belly that had been hit, coloring the Rabbit's voice with undisguised lust.

Without waiting for a response, the Rabbitbegan to bounce on the reindeer's penis. Using Hong Lu's chest for leverage, his thigh muscles accustomed to jumping contracted again and again, driving his body up and down.

The Rabbit really had a perfect physique—full muscle lines extending downward to dangerously sink at his waist, then beautifully arching up at hip. So the Reindeer wrapped his hands around that dangerous curve at the Rabbit's waist. "Mmm, yes... holding me like this, feels good, unn..." Heathcliff spared a moment between moans to praise, then sank back into the surging tide of passion. With Hong Lu's support, he quickly brought himself to a state of numbing elation, his breath hot and sticky. The continuously flowing fluid mixed with the previously shot semen into foam, smearing at their point of union.

"Ahhh!" With a suddenly rising moan, Heathcliff's tightened thighs instinctively clamped down. He came on Hong Lu's belly. A look of ecstasy, previously unseen, flashed across his face, and saliva trickled from his tongue, making their joined bodies even more tangled. Hong Lu's swallowed again. He gripped Heathcliff's waist tightly and thrust fiercely several times, successfully drawing out several soft moans. Semen washed over the Rabbit's sensitive intestinal walls after orgasm. The Rabbit's waist arched into a dangerous curve, then collapsed forward, lying on Hong Lu's chest.

"Hah... Ah, thank you, Mr. Heathcliff." Hong Lu blinked his eyes blurred by orgasm, looking up to plant a kiss on the sweat-soaked forehead of the person on top of him. After Heathcliff's chest stopped heaving violently, the Reindeer gently cupped the Rabbit's buttocks, trying to let him get off. But before he could even sit up, he was forcefully pressed back down. He looked at Heathcliff's eyes with a puzzled expression—

"I haven't had enough!"

The Rabbit's eyes were immersed in blazing desire, the afterglow of orgasm lingering in them. He simply lifted his hips and slammed down again. The wet, soft intestinal walls wrapped tightly around the penis, roughly reigniting the Reindeer's desire.

A fierce gleam, the kind that only appears in front of fresh grass, appeared on the rabbit's face—greedy and satisfied. This time Hong Lu came quickly, thanks to Heathcliff's completely unmethodical attempts and movements. While researching how to make that big thing hit the sweet spot each time, he continued to grind his teeth on Hong Lu's chest. This guy still wants to eat me, Hong Lu's thoughts began to wander. He inevitably recalled the hatchery, the recurring cycle of death and survival and being eaten. The neural pain's buzzing faintly appeared. Which one was the true individual called "self"—the one treated as food, or the one that survived? Did the Rabbit ever think about this question—

Hong Lu felt he briefly lost consciousness for a while. When his mind focused again, Heathcliff had even instinctively learned to twist his waist. His naked, lean waist swayed back and forth on the dick, creating an alluring arc. The Reindeer called the Rabbit's name softly several times, but the Rabbit seemed to hear nothing. His violet eyes were dazed and unfocused into a misty fog. His expression was completely soaked in seductiveness, brows slightly furrowed, large patches of flush showing through the dark skin at his eyes and cheeks. Lewd liquid splashed all over both their belly, and the bedding underneath had long been soaked. The fluid that flowed down from their joined parts had even pooled white and transparent in the Rabbit's knee hollows from repeated kneeling, filling up onto the bed. Could prey choose whether or not to be eaten? The Rabbit continued to enjoy the fresh grass he rightfully deserved.

Hong Lu's brain nerves screamed at him to close his eyes, but it wasn't that kind of tearing pain, just the deep exhaustion from overexertion throughout his entire body. But the pleasure coming from his penis was always real—warm liquid gushing over his sensitive top, along with refreshing friction and wrapping. Moreover, the Rabbit was never the quiet type. From start to finish, he was shamelessly moaning loudly. With each rise and fall of his groans, Honglu could feel drops of sweat, saliva, and tears falling onto his bare chest and waist. Anyway, he really was the one who wronged Mr. Heathcliff first... Hong Lu sighed deeply in his heart, patted Heathcliff's buttocks reassuringly, and let himself drift into a not-so-quiet but still peaceful sleep.

...

Heathcliff climbed off after what seemed like his umpteenth orgasm, his lower abdomen slightly swollen from being filled. Now that's about enough satisfaction. The Rabbit sat on the Reindeer's cock and rested for a few more minutes. Finally, a little dessert to finish off—hmm? Why didn't he get hard this time? The Rabbit moved his hips away. A large gush of white fluid mixed with the reindeer's ejaculate leaked from the side of his limp penis. He turned and cupped that thing with both hands, eagerly licking the tip with his tongue. There was no sign of erection. The Rabbit tasted semen and his own flavor.

Would he die? The Rabbit moved close to the Reindeer's face, carefully examining. Honglu was pale, with dark circles under his eyes, and the long period of enduring pain had etched indelible wrinkles around his mouth and brows. Heathcliff didn't like how he looked. He always felt Hong Lu should always be smiling, showing those sparkling eyes. The Rabbit tried hard to recall his few interactions with the Reindeer during his current short life. The reindeer had never shown any expression close to "happiness," Even maintaining his usual gentle nature, his mouth were always twisted into a cold smile by pain.

Where did this impression come from? Maybe other Hong Lus would smile before other Heathcliffs? In any case, he didn't like it. So he smoothed out the wrinkles between the Reindeer's brows, then poked his lips with his finger. The Reindeer was as still as a soulless body. Was he dead? The Rabbit kissed the Reindeer's ear that still radiated red flush, thought for a moment, then opened his mouth and bit down on the Reindeer's neck, slowly applying force to let his teeth sink into flesh—

Ah, not dead. The pain of cutting finally reached the Reindeer's nervous system. He frowned slightly, but made no further move. The Rabbit withdrew his teeth, his tongue wiping away the spilled blood, and smoothed out the reindeer's newly furrowed brow. His legs were numb from kneeling for so long, and the muscle soreness, previously suppressed by pleasure, gradually returned. So he became too lazy to do anything more, and just lay there on top of the reindeer. Before the next mission, they had a little time to rest.
