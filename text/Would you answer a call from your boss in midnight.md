The sound of sheets rubbing against each other was irritatingly clear in the empty bedroom, and Heathcliff gripped the blanket and turned over. Unable to sleep, he stared intently at the ceiling, trying to swallow down the restlessness rising within him.


Hong Lu had shattered all the habits of Heathcliff's decade-plus life in the Backstreets in just a few months. He should have been used to being alone, so why did this damn double bed feel so empty after that guy had only been away from the Office for two days? The nameless anger grew more intense as his thoughts focused, burning his heart with itchiness. "Fuck..." Heathcliff cursed under his breath, his fingers already slipping into his pajama.


He hesitated for a second when his fingers touched the edge of his underwear, then decisively pushed in. Masturbation had never been a pleasant thing in his memory—whether at Wuthering Heights or in the Backstreets, he rarely had enough privacy for such activities, and his unusual body structure prevented him from participating in the gang members' vulgar "mutual assistance." His fingers clumsily touched the sensitive spots on his shaft following those buried deep impressions, crude pleasure rising along with unpleasant memories. No. Heathcliff bit his lower lip, frustrated, and released his hand, reaching into the nightstand to get the little thing Hong Lu had carefully put in for him before leaving.


The latex shell was indistinct under the dim light. Heathcliff pressed it against his genital, the cold sensation making his inner thighs twitch involuntarily. He'd squeezed too much lubricant, and it dripped onto the sheets through his fingers. Heathcliff clicked his tongue in irritation, but his liquid-coated fingers still probed toward the female organ behind his penis. When the first finger entered, he tilted his head back impatiently. He'd never done this to himself before, and the strange sensation created a subtle panic in his heart, his body tensing painfully. How on earth could he have prepared to take that guy's thing... He thought randomly of Hong Lu's fingers, pressed the toy against the entrance, squeezed his legs together, then press the button.


"Mm... ah," Heathcliff arched his body, hurriedly biting down on a corner of the pillow to swallow back the moan that threatened to escape. The buzzing vibration in the room sounded like some insect's chirping, the unfamiliar frequency pressing against his clitoris and labia, making his lower back ache. Fluid trickled from his vagina to the toy and his legs. Heathcliff's trembling hands gently peeled apart the sticky labia, trying to push the toy deeper inside.


Just as his phone screen lit up and he was thinking of those two pale fingers that Hong Lu revealed from his half-glove, the ringtone suddenly blared, and Heathcliff nearly scratched himself with his nails. He lifted his head and frantically tried to hang up, but accidentally hit answer instead, and Hong Lu's voice filled with laughter spilled from the speaker.


"Heathcliff, are you asleep?"


"Fuck!" Heathcliff grabbed the phone, the sudden movement pushing the toy directly into his vagina. White spots danced before his eyes, and his wet fingers slid several times before switching back to the earpiece. He pressed the phone tightly to his ear, his voice extremely low. "What the hell are you doing calling me in the middle of the night?"


There was a brief commotion on the other end of the line, and Hong Lu seemed to have entered a quiet room. "Did I wake you? I mainly wanted to hear Heathcliff's voice—do you miss me?" The background noise of stiff fabric rubbing could be heard, and Heathcliff could imagine Hong Lu taking off his coat and removing his weapon holster.


The toy was still working continuously, and Heathcliff had to devote part of his attention to controlling his breathing. "You've only been gone for two days..." Before he could finish, it became a sharp gasp, and Heathcliff quickly buried his face in the pillow. The insides of his thighs were soaked, lubricant and arousal fluid sliding down his skin, leaving wet stains on the sheets.


"What is Heathcliff doing?" Hong Lu's voice suddenly moved closer to the microphone, speaking softly but with an unmistakable knowing smile. "Can you turn on the video and let me see?"


"Fuck off!" Heathcliff suddenly clamped his legs together, the toy being squeezed and changing angles, a wave of electric-like pleasure shooting up his spine. He frantically felt for the volume buttons, afraid his panting would leak through, "I'm hanging up if there's nothing important!"


"Don't hang up." Hong Lu's voice was as light as a feather brushing against his ear. "There's a sound on your end? So quiet, buzzing, like the toy we bought last time..."


Heathcliff pressed the switch off, and the toy immediately fell silent, but the residual vibration remained in his body, making his frame tremble slightly. His thighs clenched together restlessly, the flesh inside sucking at the now motionless toy. He tried to inject anger into his tone. "Is there anything else?"


The sound of fabric rustling came through the phone again, and he imagined Hong Lu lying down on the bed. "It'll be several more days before I can come back..." He heard Hong Lu lower his voice with a hint of aggrieved nasality. "I really want to see you right now."


Heathcliff froze—he particularly couldn't handle this tone from Hong Lu. Even though he knew the guy was absolutely acting pitiful to tease him, his fingers disobediently turned the switch back on. This time he only set it to the lowest setting, and Heathcliff closed his eyes in comfort, biting his own wrist to prevent himself from moaning.


"...Whatever." Heathcliff squeezed out the words through gritted teeth, his voice hoarse beyond recognition. His waist betrayed his will and swayed slightly, his fingers gripping the wet, slippery bottom of the toy as he slowly thrust it in and out, pleasure washing over him like warm water.


Hong Lu's breathing suddenly became clearer, as if he'd pressed the microphone to his lips. "Heathcliff xi, does this feel good?" He deliberately used that innocent, upward-tilted tone, every word seeming to carry tiny hooks. "It should go deeper, right? Slanted upward, toward inside..."


"Damn it, stop talking." Heathcliff suddenly curled his body, his fingers involuntarily following Hong Lu's instructions and pushing, thrusting the toy to that deadly spot. White light exploded before his eyes, and Hong Lu's voice pushed him directly up the long, steep slope before orgasm. Hong Lu suddenly blew against the microphone, and the warm breath seemed to pass through the barriers of space and electricity, directly hitting his ear, making Heathcliff's entire body tremble as if struck by lightning.


The orgasm crashed down urgently and violently. Heathcliff bit down on the corner of the pillow, helplessly letting out a few unbearable moans. The tightly clamped toy vibrated muffled inside him, his thigh sprayed wet and slippery, making his leg-clenching movements carry the sound of liquid friction. When he finally recovered his senses from the afterglow, he heard an undisguised light laugh from the other end of the phone.


"...Hong Lu, you damn..." Heathcliff cursed in a voice as thin as a thread, but his fingers still lingered on the toy inside him. The warm, wet flesh gently wrapped around his fingertips, and his satisfied body remained overly sensitive, every subtle movement able to ripple a tremor through his heart.


"Hmm... Heathcliff, you can take such good care of yourself even without me." Hong Lu's aggrieved words came through the electromagnetic waves. Heathcliff imagined Hong Lu's expression—definitely that seemingly innocent lowered gaze again, his eyelashes casting shadows under the screen light, covering his true expression.


The sound of rustling zippers and fabric came from across the microphone. Heathcliff's heart fluttered, and his fingers pushed deeper into his vagina. The flesh inside was unbelievably soft—he found it hard to imagine that such a soft part could exist on his body. Heathcliff had never been good at honestly facing his own desires. He closed his eyes and felt the toy's shape gradually stretching and fitting against his inner.


"But Heathcliff's nipples should want attention too, right? When we have sex before, every time I touched here, they would get very hard... Could you check for me?" After a long moment with only the exchange of subtle panting sounds, Hong Lu suddenly spoke.


"...Fuck off." Heathcliff weakly resisted, but his hand honestly moved to his chest. The moment his fingertips brushed past his nipple, a current of pleasure shot straight down to his lower abdomen. Heathcliff let out an unexpected moan, and the phone fell from his ear into the pillow.


He'd missed one of Hong Lu's sentences, but the situation didn't improve in the slightest. His nipples were hard and aching, and the desire that had just begun to calm down was burning again in his lower abdomen. He curled up his body, moved his head slightly, and sandwiched the phone between the pillow and his ear. His free hand involuntarily reached down to his genital, gently pressing against his clitoris. His mind was soaked and dizzy, the toy still buried inside him, and he heard Hong Lu's breathing become heavy. His fingers couldn't stop kneading his nipples; the sharp pleasure made him want to escape but reluctant to let go.
It was too much—he breathed out nearly whimpering gasps into the microphone and heard Hong Lu softly calling his name. Heathcliff had no mind to reply, only using his fingertips to press against his sensitive spots. He couldn't learn Hong Lu's gentle, petal-like caresses, and bright, sour pleasure flooded into his abdominal cavity. His long hair, damp with sweat, stuck to his face and scattered by his lips. He remembered how Hong Lu used to help him brush his messy long hair behind his ears at times like this, but his fingers still chased the pleasure of his nipples and clitoris, unwilling to withdraw. Maybe he just didn't want to do this himself. Heathcliff bite on a strand that had fallen into his mouth and tasted the obscure flavor of hair.


How annoying. He should have been quite unfamiliar with the emotion of "loneliness"—he'd overcome it in his memoryless childhood, and solitude had long coexisted with him. But Hong Lu had shattered everything about him without permission and melted it into this Full-Stop Office, making it part of "home." It hadn't been long at all, just spending one night alone, and he'd become this miserable. All his thoughts and physical reactions were completely dominated by another person's memories, voice, even breath...


"Ugh... Hong Lu, I'm going to kill you... when you get back." In the few seconds before orgasm, Heathcliff's voice carried a slight sob. His uterus twisted restlessly, squeezing out a wave of fluid that poured over the still-working toy inside him. The tide of desire gently pushed him back to shore.


Hong Lu let out a nasal laugh from across the phone, sticky like nectar. "You won't do that... When I get back, I'll let Heathcliff mastubate one more time in front of me." Heathcliff cursed at him again, followed by a brief silence. He could hear Hong Lu's disordered light panting on the other end, and shame suddenly shot up to Heathcliff's cheeks. He swallowed it down and hastily hung up the phone.


The room fell into suffocating silence again. The sheets were wet. Heathcliff waited until the fatigue and sleepiness rising from his muscles gradually buried him like sand (perhaps he really did fall asleep for a while) before coming to his senses, turning off the toy, and pulling it out. The dim light of dawn gradually filtered through the curtain gaps. Sour longing gradually seeped out from the depths of his heart again, and Heathcliff rolled over to Hong Lu's side of the bed, burying his still slightly feverish cheek into his pillow, quickly falling into warm, dreamless sleep.
