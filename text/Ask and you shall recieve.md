Heathcliff drowned Hong Lu in his （i）.

Heathcliff had pinned himself against the wall of the parlor in a posture of deliberate provocation. His shirt hung open at the collar, generously displaying the tattooed musculature beneath. Ever since that woman Ishmael had ascended to the vice-captain's position, Heathcliff had grown increasingly brazen under her indulgent patronage. Missing meetings had become routine, outright insubordination during missions commonplace, and even casually ordering around fellow Wakashu or summoning them alone after victory banquets—all of it he did as if it were his natural right. Hong Lu sat in the middle of the room, holding a small cup of sake, wearing that smile that never failed to ignite Heathcliff's temper.

"Did Heathcliff call me here for some particular instruction?" Hong Lu's voice was light, almost eager, as though he'd been anticipating this meeting all along—yet anyone could detect the flippant facade beneath. Heathcliff didn't like it, and what irritated him even more was that this bastard never bothered with honorifics. Heathcliff narrowed his eyes, that inexplicable restlessness fermenting in his veins alongside the alcohol. He pulled his collar open wider, exposing more tattooed skin, and stared directly at Hong Lu with the intent of a predator evaluating prey.

"Hey, I'm giving you a chance. Got nothing you want to say to me?"

"How strange. It was Heathcliff who summoned me, after all." Hong Lu tilted his head with an expression of almost innocent confusion and took a small sip from his cup.

Heathcliff snatched the cup away. Hong Lu's response clearly hadn't pleased him. Under the gaze of those slightly constricting pupils, Heathcliff splashed the remaining sake across Hong Lu's chest. The liquid seeped through the fabric as Heathcliff felt a twisted sense of satisfaction. Yet Hong Lu merely glanced down at his soaked shirt, the curve of his lips unchanged. "If there's nothing else, then I'll just—"

Heathcliff's rage flared. He seized Hong Lu by the collar and slammed him down onto the tatami. Hong Lu didn't resist—didn't even brace himself with his elbows on instinct. Startled, Heathcliff immediately cushioned the back of Hong Lu's head with his palm, the muffled impact resonating in his ears.

"You fucking..." Heathcliff pressed one knee into Hong Lu's shoulder, grabbing a fistful of long hair to force his face upward. Alcohol and fury pulsed at his temples. Hong Lu's left eye appeared almost translucent in the light, still filled with that smile that kept everyone at arm's length.

"I do this to you, and you're still smiling?" Heathcliff growled. He'd rather Hong Lu cursed him or hit him—anything but this suffocating puppet-like demeanor. The liquor-fueled anger made Heathcliff's head swim. So he rose to his feet, roughly undid his belt, let his pants slide down, exposing his half-erect naked penis and the female genitalia now slightly moistened behind, glistening with an enticing reddish sheen in the dim light. With his fingers, Heathcliff spread the soft flesh of his inner thighs, presenting the wet pussy directly to Hong Lu's face.

"What, you like this too?" Heathcliff's voice carried the roughness of intoxication, his eyes fixed on Hong Lu, anticipating a crack in that expression.

Hong Lu let out a soft laugh, warm breath washing over Heathcliff's vulva, stirring tremors like a feather's caress. Heathcliff's legs weakened, his knees sliding apart on Hong Lu's splayed hair, his sensitive labia dragging from nose to chin. His clitoris ground along the path, flushing an overripe red. Unable to withstand it, Heathcliff threw his head back and quickly squirted, fluid splashing across Hong Lu's entire face.

Hong Lu made drowning sounds beneath him, yet his lips pressed forward without hesitation—soft and moist, gently enveloping the tender flesh of Heathcliff's labia. Heathcliff's thigh muscles clenched involuntarily, trapping Hong Lu's face between them. "Y... you—fucking say something, still—still like it?" Heathcliff's momentum had been scattered by this orgasm, and though he tried to grit his teeth, his tone betrayed an undisguised note of allure.

Hong Lu's nose and mouth were blocked by the hot, soft flesh—clearly unable to answer. Something wet and slippery swept rapidly along the slit between his labia. Heathcliff's body trembled as he looked down in shock. The bastard was using his tongue! Before he could curse aloud, that tip began exploring deeper, tracing every fold of the labia, then licking at the exquisitely sensitive clitoris like sucking on candy. Finally, with a gentle suction, Heathcliff's hips lifted helplessly, then instinctively pursued even more intense pleasure. He braced himself up on trembling thighs to avoid actually smothering Hong Lu.

As the aftershocks passed, an unbearable craving climbed up his spine. He pinned Hong Lu's arms above his head and began rocking his hips, the wet, soft labia rubbing back and forth across Hong Lu's lips and tongue. His clitoris struck Hong Lu's prominent nose bridge again and again, each collision grinding it nearly into the soft flesh. Heathcliff clenched his jaw, hips swaying as he rode Hong Lu's face. The labia swelled with arousal, engorged and full, crimson blood suffusing his thighs and cheeks, heating his dark skin to a scorching temperature. Hong Lu's tongue cooperated, gliding between the labia and vaginal entrance, licking up every trickle of fluid, wet sucking and slick sounds echoing through the room. Finally, with a light kiss upon that lips, Heathcliff released an angry growl and climaxed again, water and cum gushing out together. Hong Lu closed his eyes in time to prevent the milky liquid from spraying in. The fluid ran down his chin, soaking both the tatami and his long hair.

At some point, Hong Lu had interlaced his fingers tightly with Heathcliff's, steadying his body as it tilted backward from the loss of strength. Heathcliff's whole body tingled unbearably. Before his nerves could register the danger, Hong Lu flipped him beneath, fingers firmly gripping Heathcliff's wrists. That porcelain-doll-pretty face was a complete mess, cum still clinging to his lashes, swaying and dripping with his recent violent movements. Heathcliff stared blankly at that pretty face and swallowed, his brain utterly burned out.

Hong Lu showed another of those smiles Heathcliff hated most, one hand swiftly pulling down his pants. Heathcliff's gaze followed downward. His pupils trembled with fear, and he began struggling violently. "Fuck, no, we're not compatible!"

"What do you mean, not compatible?" Hong Lu's smile vanished completely, his irises reflecting Heathcliff's eyes like glass mirrors. His fully engorged penis pressed against Heathcliff's labia, which had been licked slightly open. Heathcliff swallowed reflexively as he tried to suppress the ice-spike chill that those emotionless eyes conjured in his chest. He struggled to twist his wrists within that iron-grip restraint—goddamn, how was this guy so strong? A faint moan escaped Heathcliff's throat. Yet his sensitive labia seemed to sense the pulsing veins on that shaft, excitedly releasing another gush of warm fluid, slightly sucking on the swollen head.

"No! That's not what I meant—you, you are too big, it'll break me, ah..." Heathcliff was clearly frightened by that expression, his explanation incoherent.

"It won't break. Heathcliff is very capable." Hong Lu's face bloomed into a smile. He thrust his hips sharply, the massive head squeezing into that narrow female entrance, breaching the labia and layers of clinging inner walls in one stroke. Heathcliff's waist arched uncontrollably, his legs forced wide apart, the vaginal flesh spasming between tightening and opening—though it was the instinctive response to penetration, it appeared more like a female beast in heat, cooperating to allow the invading object smoother entry. His vagina, slick from two prior orgasms, embraced Hong Lu's penis as it drove ruthlessly to the deepest point, until the tip slipped past a slightly firm ring of flesh.

"Ugh... ahh♡♡ too—too big♡♡♡"

Heathcliff let out a helpless, high-pitched scream. The thick shaft stretched the entrance into a gaping hole, the edges whitening from the strain, inner folds nearly flattened. Hong Lu's assault had completely shattered his thoughts of resistance. He gripped Hong Lu's restraining hands desperately, nails digging deep into skin, just to find purchase between the onslaught of pleasure and fear.

Hong Lu gave him no respite, immediately beginning to pound with abandon. Each movement was precise and forceful, every thrust seeming to deliberately provoke Heathcliff's nerves, the head of his penis scraping every sensitive fold within the passage. Obscene wet sounds reverberated through the empty room, growing ever clearer with Hong Lu's accelerating rhythm. The air filled with the scent of sweat, sake, and rising lust. The stains still marked Hong Lu's face, the chaotic mixture of fluids dripping down the upturned strand of hair at his temple. Heathcliff's body clung tightly to him, every muscle spasm both rejecting and craving this invasive pleasure. Heathcliff's breathing shattered with each impact, low, hoarse moans leaking from his throat.

"Fuck... slow—slow down, you bastard!" Heathcliff snarled between thrusts, his voice fragmented with anger and need. His chest heaved violently, the coiled tattoos gleaming dimly in the sweat, seeming to writhe with their owner's undulating muscles. The exposed collar framed the beautiful, taut lines of his musculature. Yet his hips lifted unconsciously to meet the thrusts, betraying the resistance in his words, chasing that instrument carving blazing pleasure within, the sweet spot deep in the passage struck again and again. Heathcliff felt his body nearly torn apart by that thing, his clitoris still swollen and sensitive, every friction sending electric currents straight up his spine.

"Eh~ But Heathcliff is squeezing so tight here, you know?" Hong Lu leaned close to Heathcliff's face, his voice carrying a stiff, almost malicious innocence. His free hand reached down to where their bodies joined, along the stretched, wet skin, lightly touching the edges pulled to their limit. Hong Lu's fingers were gentle as petals, yet his penis didn't slow at all. Heathcliff's entire body shuddered, an irrepressible whimper escaping his throat.

"Shut... fuck, shut up, ah..." Heathcliff's cheeks burned red, shame and fury climbing his neck. What should have been a hateful roar was knocked into a different key by a thrust, emerging as a coquettish moan at his lips. He glared fiercely at Hong Lu, his eyes burning with fierce unwillingness and defiance, yet his legs spread wider involuntarily. The wet slapping of skin grew more urgent, Hong Lu's penis penetrating deeper with each thrust, until the head once more kissed that wet, hot opening at the cervix with precision.

Heathcliff's pupils contracted sharply, the fear of being completely impaled shooting up his spine, overwhelming the wave of pleasure. He gritted his teeth, a muffled growl squeezing from his throat: "Fuck... you—don't you dare..." His voice shattered with fear, yet his body lifted instinctively to meet it, his inner walls spasming and clenching. The black cloud tattoos on his reddened flanks truly began to move with his ragged breathing, flowing like ink toward his belly, coalescing into a floating dark vortex hovering over his womb, futilely protecting the vulnerable interior. Hong Lu's fingers curiously chased those ink traces, stirring more tremors across Heathcliff's skin, and those fine markings swirled around Hong Lu's fingers. "Wow~ Heathcliff, they keep following me."

"Nnh♡♡♡... what—don't thrust anymore—" Heathcliff clearly wasn't listening anymore, nor had he noticed what his tattoos had been driven to do. The coiled, concentrated patterns made him look less like a reliable clan member and more like an alluring demon crawled from the Asura realm to drain men's essence—black ink and white cum against the vivid pink flush on his dark skin. Fluid dripped profusely from the small entrance, pouring over Hong Lu's sensitive head. Hong Lu finished playing with Heathcliff's enhancement tattoos and tightened his grip on Heathcliff's wrists again, adjusting his angle slightly to grind more precisely over that sensitive soft flesh. Extreme soreness rushed from inside his body to his brain, Heathcliff's vision blackened, a sharp moan bursting from his throat, his body convulsing violently, inner walls clenching fiercely around Hong Lu's penis. A surge of fluid gushed out, trickling down where they joined, soaking the tatami beneath. "You... ngh aah♡♡♡fuck—bastard!" Heathcliff gasped out curses, his voice shattered by pleasure, the terrifying image of being completely penetrated flashing through his mind, the last thread of reason drowned by the flood of physical sensation.

"I'm not bastard, I'm Hong Lu." Hong Lu frowned slightly, each thrust deliberately driving his head hard against the cervical opening, as if testing that sealed entrance, each one making Heathcliff's heartbeat thunder. Hong Lu's thrusts grew more ferocious, yet he never truly breached that barrier. Heathcliff's moans rose higher, his inner walls spasming from continuous orgasms, the slick fluids making each impact smoother. Yet fear gradually blurred within pleasure, bodily instinct overwhelming rational resistance, his brain gradually submerging in an abyss constructed of unmetabolized alcohol and lust.

Hong Lu's jade-like cheeks had long been stained with vivid color, delicate as ripe fruit, his ink-painted brows lowered as he gazed at the person beneath him, played into a complete mess. Slight, irregular gasps issued from his nose with each pounding motion. He gripped Heathcliff's waist with both hands, fingers so forceful they nearly left bright red marks, as if to forcibly brand his imprint, his hips driving to the deepest point. His cool semen sprayed against Heathcliff's cervical opening, directly filling that mature organ at the deepest recess.

"Nnh, nnnh♡♡♡"

Heathcliff's body arched sharply, his sensitive uterine walls convulsing from the stimulation. Fluid gushed without stopping, sending him into continuous climax. The mingled fluids were trapped inside his womb by Hong Lu's still-hard penis, nearly bulging visibly. The orgasm and psychological panic of being bred utterly demolished him. He gasped for air, chest heaving violently, his tattoos gleaming darkly through the sweat, like black flames burning across his skin, the dark vortex hovering over his womb solidifying further. After release, Hong Lu collapsed intimately against him, their bodies sticking together with sweat and fluids, the air thick with lewd aftermath. Heathcliff lay with his mouth open, eyes vacant, motionless, nearly fucked unconscious.

After a long while, Hong Lu's penis finally slid from Heathcliff's pussy. The entrance had been stretched too long and couldn't fully close, white and translucent fluids trickling out intermittently. But the cervix seemed to have sealed shut after the shaft withdrew, locking more semen inside the womb, unable to flow out. Now not only had he failed to improve relations, he'd earned long-term resentment. Hong Lu fretted over this, carefully pressing Heathcliff's belly, eliciting violent tremors from muscles and tattoos.

One hand suddenly seized Hong Lu's wrist, stopping his continued probing. Having barely recovered his reason, Heathcliff propped himself up, palms braced on the tatami, knuckles white from the pressure. His chest still heaved violently, sweat and his own sprayed fluids sliding along the contours of his tattoos, the black cloud patterns slowly flowing across his skin. His pussy twitched slightly, the intermittent white fluid gleaming wetly in the dim light.

"Fuck you bast... Hong Lu, you dare touch again?" Heathcliff bared his teeth, his tone not nearly as crude as his words, instead carrying a satisfied pleasure. His fingers lightly pressed his sore lower abdomen, the ink vortex of his tattoo gradually dispersing, reforming as cloud patterns along his flanks.

"Heathcliff, you're not angry?" Hong Lu obediently withdrew his hand from Heathcliff's grasp, slowly tidying his clothing soaked with various fluids. His jade-like face had been stained into vivid color by fluids and flush. He didn't wipe the traces from his face, just sat there staring at Heathcliff.

"Hmph." Heathcliff didn't answer, simply lifting Hong Lu's chin and wiping his face clean with his sleeve. Hong Lu raised his face slightly to cooperate, his lips curving in a pleased arc. "Next time come drink with me again. Same rules."

"Eh~ So Heathcliff does like me quite a bit, right?"

"Don't flatter yourself." Heathcliff shoved Hong Lu away roughly, though the motion held no real anger. He stood up, pulling Hong Lu from the floor as well. Milky fluid trickled down from his thighs. Heathcliff staggered, a heavy gasp escaping his nose that he couldn't suppress, and grabbed Hong Lu's arm to barely steady himself. Hong Lu supported his elbow, his gaze following the trail of moisture pooling at the back of his knee, then running down his calf...

"Stop looking, get the hell out!"
